## Motivation

- In large engineering companies there is a big need for reliability data to be easily
  shared with multiple engineering groups

- Managers are often disconnected from engineers and 
  don't undertstand the reliability of ctitical
  parts which is needed in their decision making
  process
      
- Example: Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 1986.
  Management estimated the probability o-ring failure to
  to be one in a million. They did not understand the way
  temperature effects the response of the o-rings.
      
- Result: Eight lives lost in an accident that could have been 
  easily prevented.
    
- The statisical analysis to estimate reliabiliy
  can be difficult: F-tests, ANOVA, Confidence Intervals....
      
- Not everyone (or at least not yet) has taken the Coursera
  Data Science classes on statistical inference, regession
  or machine learning.  
    
- Therefore, need an easy visual way to understand the data:

## Statistical Analysis with R

- R lets you do the analysis and display the results 
- But R does allow non-R users (managers!!) perform the calculations, see
  the results and pull multiple analyses together.
- Here is the R code that performs the nonlinear regression  


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(faraway)
library(ggplot2)
prob<-orings$damage/6
temp<-orings$temp
dataFrame<-data.frame(prob,temp)
logitmod<-glm(cbind(damage,6-damage)~temp,family=binomial,orings)
x<-seq(50,85,.1)
```
```{r}
logitmod<-glm(cbind(damage,6-damage)~temp,family=binomial,orings)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4,fig.width=6}
x<-seq(50,85,.1) 
pred<-ilogit(logitmod$coeff[1]+logitmod$coef[2]*x)
predFrame<-data.frame(pred,x)
plot<-ggplot(predFrame,aes(x=x,y=pred))+geom_line(colour='blue')+xlab("Temperature")+ylab("Probability")
plot<-plot+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(50,85,5))
plot<-plot+geom_point(data=dataFrame,aes(x=temp,y=prob,size=2.5,colour='red'))+theme(legend.position="none")
plot
```

## The Component Analyzer

- Picks up where R left off.  The Component Analyser lets non-expert users perform the nonlinear regression, view data from multiple sources and quicky understand how enviornmental influences can affect the probability of part failure.

- Here is an image from a prototype. You can set the part type and environmental factor.

## Summary


- For data about the reliability of component parts to be useful it must be analyzed.

- For this analysis to be useful it must be shared within an organization.

- The Component Analyzer allows data regarding the reliability of part to be viewed throughout a corporation.

- We have a working prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the product. 

- Future work will involve incorporating RCharts for dynamic images, and adding more parts.
